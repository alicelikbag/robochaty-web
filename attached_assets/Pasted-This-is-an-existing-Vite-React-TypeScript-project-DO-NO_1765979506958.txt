This is an existing Vite + React + TypeScript project.
DO NOT change routing logic.
DO NOT remove any existing components.
Only update header branding and logo usage safely.

==================================================
1️⃣ HEADER / NAVBAR BRANDING
==================================================

Update the main header / navbar brand area.

Brand text should appear as:

RoboChaty
AI Assistant Bot

Design rules:
- "RoboChaty" → larger, bold, primary brand color
- "AI Assistant Bot" → smaller subtitle, lighter opacity
- Stack text vertically (not inline)
- Align to the left side of the navbar
- Modern Web3 startup look

Typography:
- Use Poppins
- RoboChaty: font-weight 700
- AI Assistant Bot: font-weight 400, letter-spacing slightly increased

==================================================
2️⃣ LOGO INTEGRATION (SAFE & REUSABLE)
==================================================

Assume a logo file will be provided later.
Prepare the code to easily plug in a logo image.

Create a reusable Logo component OR logo block that supports:
- Image logo
- Text fallback (RoboChaty)

Use the logo in these locations:
- Header / Navbar (left side, next to brand text)
- Hero section (subtle, decorative use)
- Footer (small, clean version)

Rules:
- Logo should NOT overpower content
- Use soft glow or subtle drop shadow
- Maintain aspect ratio
- Responsive sizing for mobile

Use a placeholder path like:
"/assets/logo.png"

Add comments in code:
"// Replace with official RoboChaty logo"

==================================================
3️⃣ HERO SECTION LOGO USAGE
==================================================

In the Home page hero section:
- Add the logo above or behind the main title
- Use low opacity or soft floating animation
- Decorative only (non-interactive)

==================================================
4️⃣ FOOTER LOGO USAGE
==================================================

In the footer:
- Small logo
- Brand text:
  RoboChaty – AI Assistant Bot
- Social icons remain visible

==================================================
5️⃣ STYLING
==================================================

Update index.css:

- Add logo sizing utilities
- Add subtle floating animation
- Use brand colors:
  #7C5CFF, #00E5FF, #FF7AD9
- Avoid heavy shadows
- Keep everything premium and clean

==================================================
FINAL EXPECTATION
==================================================

- Brand identity is clear and consistent
- Header looks like a real Web3 product
- Logo is reusable and easy to replace later
- No routing or layout breaks
- TypeScript safe
